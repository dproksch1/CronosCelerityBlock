To install library use usual steps:

1. To just configure the library for general use call
   ./configure.sh 
If you woule like to automatically set the related envirnoment
variable 'NUMLIB_ROOT_DIR' use
   source ./configure.sh 
instead

2. Call
   make

3. Call
   make install

As a result sub-directories include and lib/'SomeName' are created
containing the headers and the libraries, respectively. Here,
'SomeName' depends on the archtecture, where corresponding flags can
be defined in the respective files in the makeinclude directory.
