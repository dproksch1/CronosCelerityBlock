# CronosCode

#### Steps to use the Cronos code by way of a standard testing example:

1. Checkout and install the CronosNumLib project (follow the README there)
2. Checkout the CronosCode project
3. From the CronosCode directory execute `./configure.sh 'path-to-CronosNumLib'`
4. Change to the desired working directory, e.g., to cronos/Testing/LinearWaves
and compile the setup via make.
5. You can built your own project, e.g., by copying any directory in the testing path and creating new module files. Check the documentation under `cronos/release_docs` for further instructions.
